            <h2>You all right, Dexter?</h2>
            <p>Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. You look…perfect. Only you could make those words cute. I like seafood. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>

            <h2>I'm generally confused most of the time.</h2>
            <p>I'm a sociopath; there's not much he can do for me. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm partial to air conditioning. This man is a knight in shining armor.<br />
            I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.
            I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. This man is a knight in shining armor. I'm doing mental jumping jacks.</p>
            <p>Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Cops, another community I'm not part of. I'm doing mental jumping jacks. I have a dark side, too. I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.<br />
            Rorschach would say you have a hard time relating to others. Watching ice melt. This is fun. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.</p>

            <p>You're a killer. I catch killers. He taught me a code. To survive. You look…perfect. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Tell him time is of the essence.<br />
            Taught me a code. To survive. I think he's got a crush on you, Dex! I'm really more an apartment person. I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm generally confused most of the time. Cops, another community I'm not part of.</p>
